The debugging process consists of two things:
- Break points.
- Reading memory.

## Break Points
You can set a break point on any line of your code and it will pause there.

### Debugging Buttons

This button will continue to the next breakpoint.

#### Step Into(F11)
This button steps into the function that is selected.  

#### Step Over(F10)
This button continues to the next line

#### Step Out(Shift + F11)
This button will step out of the function that you went into and get back to where it was called.
