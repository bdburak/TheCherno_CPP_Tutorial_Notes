# TheCherno_CPP_Tutorial_Notes
My study notes for the [The Cherno C++ tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb). I mostly write my notes on the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app. You can either use it to view my notes or you can just view them in your favorite markdown viewer/editor.
The files are unordered but if you look at the series list.
